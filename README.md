### :bangbang: Weights release :bangbang:

Please find the weights used for CytoFM [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iG1OcQTzXNzpjnSXHu79Zs5WqyTznf4a/view?usp=sharing). We have provided a notebook with an example of how to load in weights to the vit_base model adapted from the iBOT github. Setting up the iBOT code is a requirement to run this notebook. Please feel free to open an issue or send an email if there are any questions. 



### Acknowledgement
The code for this project was built using [iBOT: Image BERT Pre-Training with Online Tokenizer](https://github.com/bytedance/ibot).
